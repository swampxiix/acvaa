S'Professor Jennie Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s Festschrift meeting \xe2\x80\x98Anaesthesia and Critical Care in the 21st Century; the First Decade\xe2\x80\x99 which is taking place at the BT Convention Centre in Liverpool on 12th-13th May 2011. As you will see, the calibre of the speakers is extremely high with all nationally and internationally recognised. In particular, we have two speakers from New York including the editor in chief of Anesthesia and Analgesia, Professor Steven Schafer, who will give the first T. Cecil Gray BJA Lecture. In addition, the President of the RCA, Dr Peter Nightingale will also be speaking. The contents of the meeting will make up the July Postgraduate Educational Issue of the BJA.\r\n\r\nRarely do we have such a high quality meeting in Liverpool and I anticipate that this will be a very popular national meeting so early application is recommended. There is a reduced rate for all LSA members and daily rates are also available.\r\n\r\nEwen Forrest\r\nHon Sec\r\n\r\nThe following details can be used to obtain the booking form or registering for the meeting: THE BOOKING FORM CAN BE OBTAINED FROM: www.lsoa.org.uk/festschrift \r\n\r\nOr\r\nGeorgina Hall, Med Symposiums \r\n19 Hall Drive, Greasby, Wirral, CH49 1RW\r\nTel/Fax 0151 522 0259 \r\nMobile: 07901 717 380 \r\nEmail: medsymp@btinternet.com'
