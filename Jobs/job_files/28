S'The Veterinary Specialty Hospital of San Diego is looking for an anesthesiologist to join our practice.  This position truly combines the best of academia and private practice.\r\n\r\nVeterinary Specialty Hospital (VSH) is a 24-hour state of the art facility.  Members of our team include 5 board certified surgeons (one of whom is also boarded in ophthalmology), 6 internists, 3 neurologists/neurosurgeons, a radiation oncologist, 2 medical oncologists, dermatologist, radiologist, and a criticalist.  We are staffed 24 hours including an emergency service, with an extensive technical staff that is highly skilled and motivated.  \r\n\r\nOur in-house imaging equipment includes two digital radiography suites with digital fluoroscopy, a Siemens 6-slice spiral CT unit, a Siemens 1.0 T MRI unit with numerous coils, three ultrasound machines (two with color Doppler), and a gamma camera.  A fully integrated PACS system interfaces with all of our imaging modalities.  Therapeutic modalities include a Varian Linear Accelerator and I-131.  Our facility is also supported by an in-house full service commercial laboratory.  The surgical and internal medicine equipment are state-of-the-art.  \r\n\r\nWe have active internship and residency programs (internal medicine, critical care, dermatology, and ophthalmology) which enable the anesthesia position to combine clinical service and teaching.   We have regular lectures and rounds for our interns and residents which would provide a great format for more formal teaching. There are also several ongoing research projects which could benefit from the expertise of an anesthesiologist.  \r\n\r\nThere is a collaborative and on-site relationship with U.C. Davis.  Their program includes a full-time nephrologist dedicated to hemodialysis and lower urinary tract diseases, a cardiologist, nutrition service, and a veterinary pharmacy program.  We have just initiated a joint renal transplant program with our staff and the U.C. Davis staff.  The anesthesiologist would also collaborate on cases with the U.C. Davis faculty.\r\n\r\nThe anesthesia position is designed to upgrade our general anesthesia protocols, provide oversight to critical and non-critical patients when directed (clinician and client), and explore developing a pain control clinic.  We expect the ideal candidate to also help facilitate work flow in the surgery department, yet be adaptive to general hospital and patient needs.  There are approximately 2200 major anesthetic procedures per year.  As one of many other examples of being a progressive practice, VSH would be the only hospital in Southern California to have an anesthesiologist on staff.  We promote our hospital in professional and effective ways, and there is an expectation of this position for networking and involvement with our referring veterinary community.\r\n\r\n\r\nA competitive salary and benefits package is provided.  There are also numerous opportunities for collaboration with the human medical facilities within close proximity, including Scripps and UCSD.  \r\n\r\nThe quality of life can\xe2\x80\x99t be better than in \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s Finest City\xe2\x80\x9d.  Cultural and recreational opportunities are unlimited and available year round.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not our bells and whistles that make us special\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s our culture.  Join us!  \r\n'
