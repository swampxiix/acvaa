S"Pittsburgh Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Center is currently seeking an anesthesiologist to complement our busy referral surgical practice and provide anesthesia support for our other specialty services. PVS-EC is western Pennsylvania's premier multi-specialty referral practice. PVS-EC occupies a new 31,000 sq ft state of the art facility in central Pittsburgh PA.\r\n \r\nThe successful candidate will interact with 5 boarded surgeons, a neurologist/neurosurgeon, and surgical resident.  Enjoy a competitive salary and benefits package as well as all of the advantages of interacting with experienced colleagues. Benefits of our practice include 24 hour care with 3 residency trained criticalists (1 boarded). Another benefit is consultation and interaction with boarded ophthalmologists, internists, dermatologists, oncologists, veterinary dentist, radiation oncologist, and a cardiologist. We are equipped to do most surgical procedures, including minimally invasive surgery, and all operating rooms have advanced monitoring and ventilators. In our facility, we have on site high-field MRI, CT, comprehensive oncology program (including radiation therapy), and critical care medicine as well as other benefits expected in a large veterinary medical facility. We currently have 1 surgical resident and 5 interns and are committed to teaching as well as providing excellent service to our clients. \r\n\r\nWestern Pennsylvania is a beautiful part of the country that offers the amenities of a large city such as excellent theater, opera, ballet, concerts and more. Additionally, there are excellent outdoor adventures such as kayaking, hiking, fishing, and rock climbing within a short drive. No discussion of Pittsburgh would be complete without mention of our professional sports teams: the 6 time world champion Steelers, the Pirates and the world champion Penguins. Pittsburgh is also the home of several colleges and universities offering college sporting events as well. The Pittsburgh suburbs have excellent school systems and affordable living. \r\n\r\nCandidates must have completed an ACVA approved residency or be board certified in Veterinary Anesthesia. Study time will be provided if needed."
